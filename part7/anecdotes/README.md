React offers 15 different built-in hooks, of which the most popular ones are the useState and useEffect hooks that we have already been using extensively.

React offers the option to create custom hooks. According to React, the primary purpose of custom hooks is to facilitate the reuse of the logic used in components.

Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

Custom hooks are regular JavaScript functions that can use any other hooks, as long as they adhere to the rules of hooks. Additionally, the name of custom hooks must start with the word use.
